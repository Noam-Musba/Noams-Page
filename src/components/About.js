        Noam is a 27 years old fella, born and raised in <b>Israel</b>, Hadera.
        <br />
        He likes to hang out with friends, but also likes to just stay at home,
        play a computer game or reading. <br />
        Also, he is <b>playing the guitar</b>, mainly the electric guitar, for
        more than 13 years. <br />
        He is a big believer in <b>eating healthy and exercising</b> to
        maintain a healthy body and mind. <br />
        After finishing High School with a{" "}
        <em>Diploma majored in Physics and Chemistry</em>,
        <br />
        he was enlisted to the IDF, in the <em>Air Defense troops</em>. <br />
        There, he became a commander, lead his troops and then even became a
        commander of commanders. <br />

        writing this 'About', he is still waiting for the ceremony to get the
        official Diploma :( <br />
        While looking for a job, he (me?) found about React, HTML and CSS, and
        the curiosity <br />
        made him to learn these subjects, and in the end, create this page!{" "}
